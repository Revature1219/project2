## Description

​The Itsy app is a web-based application that will provide simple implementation of seller/customer interactions. Anyone should be able to browse the contents of the website’s sellers’ consumables. After registering an account, customers should be able to place orders for items with the option of contacting the seller about potential special orders/requests. Sellers should be able to register an account, post items they wish to sell, and communicate with any customer who contacts them.
